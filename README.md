# AES-128-EBC x DNA-Encryption
an implementation of AES-128 EBC mode combined with DNA Encryption in pure python using only the built-in libraries. 

this is only for practice. not safe for use.

works fine as of now. 


i have absolutely no idea how the mix column stage in og AES works. see Sec 4.1.2 in The Design of Rijndael.
